# **MEAN-Todo-App (Angular)**

A Mongo, Express, Angular, Node TODO application. The technology stack is visible from the acronym MEAN, however let me point out the following facts:

1. For Mongo (database layer) I used MLAB that offers a mongo database on the cloud. You consume the API offered to manipulate, push, edit your non relational database.

2. Well Express is just Express 4.0.
3. Angular is Angular 2.
4. Node is version 8, so I am using/trying ES6.
